################# WARNING ####################
# The AutoSave System should be turned off until Mojang fixes the BDS-2733 bug
# preventing the MANIFEST and LOG files from being saved while the server is running.
# Bug Tracker Link: https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/BDS-2733
#
# This means that your world will only be properly backed up when the
# server restarts using the auto restart system.
# Once this bug is fixed I would recommend setting
# auto_save to true and the save_interval and backup_intervals to 60 minutes.
#
# How this currently works: If auto_save is set to true,
# the system will run the "save hold" command on the server
# at the interval set by save_interval.
# It will also copy the world files to the saves directory (above)
# during the save process when the backup_interval is reached.
#
# So basically, the save_interval determines how often the database
# is "saved" (not backed up) and the backup_interval determines how
# often the game makes a backup during the save process.
#
# Currently this does not work do to the bug, and the MANIFEST and LOG
# files fail to copy resulting in errors.
# This system is only needed in case of a major crash that affects
# the world database which is extremely unlikely to occur.

# Auto Save System: Saves every x minutes
auto_save=false

# Auto Save Interval (Minutes)
save_interval=60

# Auto Backup Interval (Minutes)
# How often the game makes a full backup (MANIFEST / .log File Copy Bug as of 6/2/20 making backups void)
backup_interval=60

########################################

# Auto Restart System
# Options: interval|time
# Setting auto_restart to "interval" will make the server restart every "restart_interval" hours.
# Setting it to "time" will make the server restart at the times specified in "restart_times".
auto_restart=time

# If you would prefer the server to restart at specific intervals, then set the number of hours between restarts.
# Integer: restart every X hours				
restart_interval=12

# If you would prefer the server to restart at specific times of day then use the time option and list the times here
# Comma Separated Times 06:00,12:00,18:00 etc					
restart_times=00:00,06:00,12:00,18:00

# Keep Alive
# If true then the system will restart the server if it's not running. Ideal to prevent it staying off after a crash.
keepalive=false


#### THE ROLL BACK SYSTEM IS OUTDATED AND NOT WORKING FULLY. DO NOT USE! ####
# What should happen if rollback is set to true, is that if the server
# cannot load the world after a number of attempts, it will copy the 
# broken world to the saves folder with the prefix "FAILED_" and then 
# overwrite the server with the most recent successful backup that was taken.
# This is untested as issues were found with the Mojang BDS bug as noted above.

# Rollback
# If server cannot start the system will attempt to rollback to a previous save and try again
# The failed world is backed up in the saves folder prefix FAILED_ before overwriting
# The rolled back save is prefixed with ROLLBACK_ to identify which save was used
rollback=false
